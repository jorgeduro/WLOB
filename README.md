CREATE a new repository, directory
--> git init
checkout a repository
copy of a local repository
--> git clone /path/to/repository
copy of a remote server
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

WORKFLOW
your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git.
1 - Working Directory which holds the actual files.
2 - the Index which acts as a staging area.
3 - HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.

ADD & COMMIT
You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
--> git add <filename>
--> git add *
To actually commit these changes use
--> git commit -m "Commit message"
Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

PUSHING CHANGES
Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, EXECUTE
--> git push origin master
Change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.
If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with
--> git remote add origin <server>
Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server

BRANCHING
Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.


CREATE NEW BRANCH named "feature_x" and switch to it using
--> git checkout -b feature_x
SWITCH BACK TO MASTER
--> git checkout master
DELETE BRANCH again
--> git branch -d feature_x
a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your remote repository
--> git push origin <branch>

UPDATE & MERGE
to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute
--> git pull
in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.
to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use
--> git merge <branch>
in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes. Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in conflicts. You are responsible to merge those conflicts manually by editing the files shown by git. After changing, you need to mark them as merged with
--> git add <filename>
before merging changes, you can also preview them by using
--> git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>

TAGGING
it's recommended to create tags for software releases. this is a known concept, which also exists in SVN. You can create a new tag named 1.0.0 by executing
git tag 1.0.0 1b2e1d63ff
the 1b2e1d63ff stands for the first 10 characters of the commit id you want to reference with your tag. You can get the commit id by looking at the...
log
in its simplest form, you can study repository history using.. git log
You can add a lot of parameters to make the log look like what you want. To see only the commits of a certain author:
--> git log --author=bob
To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line:
--> git log --pretty=oneline
Or maybe you want to see an ASCII art tree of all the branches, decorated with the names of tags and branches:
--> git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
See only which files have changed:
--> git log --name-status
These are just a few of the possible parameters you can use. For more, see git log --help
replace local changes
In case you did something wrong, which for sure never happens ;), you can replace local changes using the command
--> git checkout -- <filename>
this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.

If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this
--> git fetch origin
--> git reset --hard origin/master
